  The path of a person's life is already somewhat planned out. You go to school, and afterwards you find a job, then start a family. That's the norm of things in our society. Of course this doesn't apply to all cultures and everywhere around the world, but it applies to me. It was what was expected of me since I was a child. At one point, I became disillusioned with this expectation, because I saw it conflicting the the notion of choice. What if I didn't want to go through the norm? There was always the choice of that, but it would be looked down upon, and who wants to be a disappointment? Suffice to say, I did go through the norm. Most of life I didn't have much aim, and was just going through the motions. With time, I realized there is choice in choosing of one's path. I've met many people who did not go through the "norm". For me, I think it would've been hard if I wanted to do things differently. Mainly because of my family's expectations, and not wanting to disappoint them. Now that I'm actually on my own, I feel I can moreso decide what's best for me without the fear of disapproval. I chose to quit my finance job and do coding. My parent's didn't exactly approve of that, but I know it's the right choice for me currently. Change is hard.
