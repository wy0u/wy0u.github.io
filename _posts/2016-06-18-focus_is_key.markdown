   It's been a month since I resigned from my job to focus on the program full-time. It was a strange thing at first to wake up and not have to put on work clothes and head to work. It's what I've been doing for the past two years. So far I'm enjoying it. I mentioned during my previous blog post, that time was just moving way too fast when I did the work routine thing. I think it's because my mind kind of shuts off and goes into auto pilot since my job didn't require much creative thinking. Now that I'm learning something new, I'm constantly problem solving. Time seems to have slowed down since I'm working at my own pace. I still have a schedule, but there is definitely flexibility when you're at home without the fear of being fired. That brings me to the main topic of this post which is about focus. It's kind of a double-edged sword when you're working at home without the fear because it allows you to slack off without any immediate consequence. You're not going to get yelled at if you take a day off. It's just easy to procrastinate. You understand procrastinating will just result in a delay of your primary goal and there might be additional expenses, but that won't happen until in the future, so the mind might rationalize that it's okay. 
  
   I haven't been as focused as I'd like to be. Sure sometimes life happens and you have to divert attention to elsewhere, but to be honest I've taken more breaks than I should. Something is bad for you when it causes a negative impact on your goals. I think I just need that constant reminder of what the main goal is, and that's to be a developer. It definitely helps me focus more on my studies.
