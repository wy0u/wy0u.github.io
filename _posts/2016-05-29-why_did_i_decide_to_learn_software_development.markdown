    It was a decision that was not made overnight. I formally worked at a bank as an accountant. I never had a real passion for financial services. I majored in accounting in college, and it made sense to work a job in a relevant field after graduation. As time passed, I grew weary of the routine. Go to work, go home, dinner, have some time to myself, repeat the next day. Whilst in school, I actually dreaded this cycle that I will have to enter eventually. Now that I was in it, it's a real drag. I felt like time was just moving way too fast and I don't even know where it all went. Everyday felt the same. Something was missing.
    
    A job is a job. Most people work to earn a living; it's a necessity. I had a job that provided for my expenses in life, which I am grateful for. Still, I didn't feel content. I knew that the job I had was not what I wanted to be doing for the rest of my life. Most of our lives will be spent working and for me personally, I need to enjoy what I'm doing. I believe that people should do what makes them happy. I was not, so I decided I needed to change. 
    
    Programming is something I've had an interest in ever since I took a programming course in High School. For whatever reason, I did not pursue a career in programming. Now that I've decided to make a change and pursue an interest, software development was on the top of my life. As previously mentioned, it was a programming class that sparked my interest. I remembered coding as a challenge, a puzzle, and I remembered the satisfaction of solving it and getting an application to work exactly the way I wanted it to. Such are feelings I haven't felt in a long time. After some time thinking about where I wanted my future self to be, I decided to quit my bank job and focus on learning programming. Of course I planned out my financial needs first and saw that focusing on this full time was a possibility. Currently I am treating learning programming as my full-time job and so far, I'm quite enjoying it.
